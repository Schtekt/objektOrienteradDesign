GoodCollection:
	The vector holds pointers to all goods
GoodSpaceHandler:
	getcurrentGoodSpace is changed to return a pointer of a goodspace.
	added a function "getSize"
Truck:
	The good is a pointer...
	getGood returns a bool, since we do not know if the truck actually holds a object.
	setGood returns a bool, if the truck already carries a good then we should not be able to switch it.
	added a function setCarries to edit if a truck carries a good or not.
